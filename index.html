    <p>My project was about recreating the "Lights Out" Puzzle in a way
      that could be represented extremely easily through mathematics.
      <br><br>
      There are only a few main components of \(f(X)\)
      <br><br>
      \(O\) represents the matrix responsible for the basic operation that
      is done when you click on one of the squares. In this puzzle, clicking on
      a square will result in that one changing its state (on->off, off->on) and
      also changing the adjacent squares' states. There are only two states in
      this puzzle: on and off. Numerically, these two states can be represented
      numerically as 0 (to represent the off state)
      and 1 (to represent the on state).<br>
      \(O=\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & -1 & 0\\ 
      -1 & -1 & -1\\ 
      0 & -1 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}\)<br>
      If \(X_{2,2}\) was the square you clicked on, then adding \(O\) to
      \(X\) would properly do that operation. For example,
      \[O+X=\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & -1 & 0\\ 
      -1 & -1 & -1\\ 
      0 & -1 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 1\\ 
      1 & 1 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & -1 & 1\\ 
      0 & 0 & -1\\ 
      0 & -1 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}\]
      And now take the absolute value<br>
      \[\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & -1 & 1\\ 
      0 & 0 & -1\\ 
      0 & -1 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}^{abs}=\begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 1 & 1\\ 
      0 & 0 & 1\\ 
      0 & 1 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}\]
      <div>
        <img src="img/p1.png" width=200 height=200>
        <p> \(\longrightarrow\) </p>
        <img src="img/p2.png" width=200 height=200>
      </div>
      However, \(O\) has to be changed in order to do the operations for the
      other squares. This is achievable by using shift matrices. One other
      alternative could have been to use rotation matrices, but you would need
      to develop a new strategy for puzzles that are larger than a 3x3 matrix.
      Creating nine different versions of the operation matrix \(O\) to fit
      each of the different positions would become very tedious. Instead, the
      most efficient and simple solution is to use shift matrices to "translate"
      the operation matrix. That way, there would be no need to individually
      write every possibility.<br><br>
      \(U\) and \(L\) are both shift matrices. \(U\) is the upper shift matrix,
      meaning that it is equal to the identity matrix but already translated up
      by one. \(L\) is the lower shift matrix, which is pretty much the same as
      the upper shift matrix but going one down instead. Here is how they work:
      <ul>
        <li>\(U \times M = \) M translated one row up</li>
        <li>\(M \times U = \) M translated one column right</li>
        <li>\(L \times M = \) M translated one row down</li>
        <li>\(M \times L = \) M translated one column left</li>
      </ul>
      For example,
      \[M = \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 0\\ 
      0 & 1 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}\]
      \[U \times M \times L =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 1 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 1\\ 
      0 & 0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix} \times
      \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 0\\ 
      0 & 1 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix} \times
      \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 0\\ 
      1 & 0 & 0\\ 
      0 & 1 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}=
      \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 0\\ 
      0 & 0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}\]
      M is translated one row up \(U \times M\) and then M is translated one
      column to the left \(M \times L\).<br>
      Now, try that with the operation matrix \(O\).<br>
      <div>
        <p>\(O\) Before</p>
        <img src="img/p3.png">
        <p>\(O\) After</p>
        <img src="img/p4.png">
      </div>
      This shows that the lights out puzzle can be recreated purely in
      mathematics in a simple and easy to understand way.<br>
